            <p>Eating healthy will improve your self-confidence and relationships. Consuming a healthy diet makes you
                feel a whole lot better both inside and out, which leads to higher self-confidence. When you eat well,
                sleep well and are in good mental health - you tend to feel a lot better about yourself and the world
                around you.</p>

            <h1>More to Know</h1>
            <p>People often turn their noses up at cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, Brussels sprouts or
                broccoli, and for good reason: "With cruciferous vegetables, we often think they just taste bitter, but
                data suggests that the aroma is also a big part that people are reacting to," says Lim. Cauliflower and
                company contain smelly sulfurous compounds, which are there, in part, to protect the plants from animals
                and insects.</p>
